**Key Changes in the Updated Design:**

* **SQS Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ):** Explicit DLQs are added for the primary SQS queue and potentially for any internal queues within the processing Lambda.  
* **DynamoDB On-Demand:** DynamoDB is now specified to use On-Demand capacity mode for better handling of variable workloads.  
* **DynamoDB Streams:** The Snowflake ingestion Lambda is explicitly triggered by DynamoDB Streams for near real-time processing.  
* **Batching in Lambdas:** Both Lambdas are expected to perform batch processing of records for efficiency.  
* **S3 Lifecycle Policies:** The S3 staging bucket will have lifecycle policies for cost management.  
* **Optimized Snowflake Warehouse:** The Snowflake data mart will utilize an appropriately sized and potentially auto-scaling virtual warehouse.

**II. Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**1\. Introduction**

* **1.1 Purpose:** This document outlines the product requirements for a centralized audit data recording and analytics system for the Wealth Management team at \[Bank Name\]. This system will capture audit events from multiple wealth management applications, securely store them, and make them available for analysis and reporting in a Snowflake data mart.  
* **1.2 Audience:** This document is intended for the development team, infrastructure team, security team, data analytics team, and relevant stakeholders within the Wealth Management and IT departments.  
* **1.3 Scope:** This project will encompass the design, development, deployment, and initial configuration of the audit data pipeline within the AWS cloud, including integration with existing wealth management applications and the Snowflake data warehouse.

**2\. Goals**

* Provide a comprehensive and auditable record of significant actions within wealth management applications.  
* Enhance compliance efforts by providing readily accessible audit trails.  
* Enable data-driven insights into system usage, potential security risks, and operational efficiency.  
* Ensure the security and integrity of sensitive audit data through obfuscation and encryption.  
* Provide a scalable and performant solution to handle current and future audit data volumes.

**3\. Functional Requirements**

* **FR1: Audit Event Ingestion:** The system must be capable of ingesting audit events from multiple wealth management applications in near real-time.  
* **FR2: Data Obfuscation:** Sensitive data within audit events must be obfuscated by the source applications before being ingested into the system using Micro Focus Voltage.  
* **FR3: Secure Transport:** Audit events must be securely transmitted from the source applications to the central system using HTTPS over TLS.  
* **FR4: Reliable Queuing:** A queuing mechanism (AWS SQS) must be in place to ensure reliable delivery of audit events and decouple source applications from processing.  
* **FR5: Data Processing and Validation:** A processing component (AWS Lambda) must validate the structure and content of audit events.  
* **FR6: Data Persistence:** Processed audit events must be securely persisted in a scalable data store (AWS DynamoDB) with encryption at rest using KMS.  
* **FR7: Near Real-Time Data Streaming:** The system must stream audit data from the persistent store to the Snowflake data mart with minimal latency using DynamoDB Streams and AWS Lambda.  
* **FR8: Data Staging:** An intermediate storage layer (AWS S3) must be used for staging data before loading into Snowflake.  
* **FR9: Efficient Data Loading:** The system must utilize Snowflake's Snowpipe for efficient and continuous loading of audit data into the data mart.  
* **FR10: Data Transformation (Optional):** The processing Lambda may perform basic data transformations or enrichments as needed before persistence.  
* **FR11: Error Handling and Dead-Letter Queuing:** The system must implement robust error handling, including the use of DLQs for failed messages at the SQS level.  
* **FR12: Logging and Monitoring:** All components of the system must generate comprehensive logs accessible through AWS CloudWatch Logs. Key metrics must be monitored using CloudWatch Metrics with appropriate alarms.

**4\. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **NFR1: Security:**  
  * Audit data must be encrypted at rest in DynamoDB and S3 using AWS KMS.  
  * Sensitive data must be obfuscated at the source using Micro Focus Voltage.  
  * Access to AWS resources must be controlled using the principle of least privilege via IAM roles and policies.  
  * Network security should be considered using VPCs, Security Groups, and NACLs as appropriate.  
* **NFR2: Performance:** The system must be able to handle \[Expected Volume\] audit events per second/minute with acceptable latency (e.g., end-to-end latency from event generation to availability in Snowflake should be under \[Target Time\]).  
* **NFR3: Scalability:** The system must be highly scalable to accommodate fluctuations in audit event volume and future growth. AWS Lambda, DynamoDB (On-Demand), SQS, S3, and Snowflake provide inherent scalability.  
* **NFR4: Reliability and Availability:** The system should be designed for high availability. Critical components should be deployed with redundancy across Availability Zones where possible. SQS ensures message delivery, and DynamoDB offers high availability.  
* **NFR5: Cost-Efficiency:** The system should be designed and configured to optimize costs, leveraging appropriate AWS service tiers and configurations (e.g., Lambda memory allocation, S3 lifecycle policies, DynamoDB On-Demand).  
* **NFR6: Maintainability:** The system should be designed with modularity and clear separation of concerns to facilitate maintenance and updates. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) should be used for managing the infrastructure.  
* **NFR7: Auditability of the System:** Access logs and configuration changes to the audit system itself should be auditable.

**5\. Data Requirements**

* **5.1 Audit Event Schema:** A standardized schema for audit events will be defined, including mandatory fields (e.g., timestamp, user ID, action performed, resource affected, source application) and application-specific fields. This schema will accommodate obfuscated sensitive data fields.  
* **5.2 Data Retention:** Data retention policies will be defined for both the operational store (DynamoDB) and the data warehouse (Snowflake) based on compliance and business requirements.

**6\. Release Criteria**

* Successful deployment of all components in the AWS environment.

* **2.2 Component Details:**  
  * **Wealth Management Applications (Producers):**  
    * **Technology:** ASP.NET Core 8 applications.
    * **Responsibility:** Generate audit events in a defined JSON format, integrate with Micro Focus Voltage for data obfuscation, and publish events to the designated SNS topic using the AWS SDK for .NET.
    * **Integration:** Configuration will be required in each application to specify the SNS topic ARN and Voltage endpoint.
  * **SNS Topic (Audit Events):**  
    * **Service:** AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS).

  * **Snowflake Data Mart:**  
    * **Service:** Snowflake Data Warehouse.  
    * **Purpose:** Central repository for audit data, optimized for analytics and reporting.  
    * **Configuration:** A dedicated database and schema for audit data. Appropriate virtual warehouse size and auto-scaling configuration. Network policies to restrict access.  
    * **Snowpipe:** Configured to continuously ingest data from the designated S3 bucket based on file arrival.  
  * **IAM Roles and Policies:** Detailed definition of IAM roles and policies for each AWS component, adhering to the principle of least privilege. This includes roles for the Lambda functions, access permissions for SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, S3, and trust relationships.  
  * **KMS Key:** Specification of the KMS key(s) to be used for encrypting data at rest in DynamoDB and S3. Access policies for the key(s) will be defined.

**3\. Data Flow**

1. A wealth management application (ASP.NET Core 8) generates an audit event.
2. Sensitive data within the event payload is obfuscated using Micro Focus Voltage.
3. The obfuscated audit event is published to the designated SNS topic over HTTPS using the AWS SDK for .NET.
4. The SNS topic pushes the event to the subscribing SQS queue.
5. The ASP.NET Core 8 processing Lambda function polls the SQS queue for batches of messages.
6. The Lambda processes each message, validates its structure, performs basic transformations, and writes it to the DynamoDB table using the AWS SDK for .NET.
7. New records written to the DynamoDB table trigger the DynamoDB Stream.
8. The Python-based Snowflake ingestion Lambda function reads batches of records from the DynamoDB Stream.
9. The Lambda transforms the data into a suitable format (e.g., JSON), compresses it, and uploads it to the designated S3 staging bucket.
10. The arrival of new files in the S3 bucket triggers the Snowpipe in Snowflake.
11. Snowpipe loads the data from the S3 files into the target tables in the Snowflake data mart.
12. The Wealth Management team can then query and analyze the audit data in Snowflake for various purposes.

**4\. Security Design**

* **Data Obfuscation:** Micro Focus Voltage integration at the application level.  
* **Encryption in Transit:** HTTPS/TLS for communication between applications and SNS.  
* **Encryption at Rest:** AWS KMS encryption for DynamoDB and S3.  
* **Access Control:** IAM roles and policies with the principle of least privilege for all AWS resources. Snowflake RBAC for controlling access to audit data.  
* **Network Security:** Consider VPCs, Security Groups, and NACLs to restrict network access to the components.  
* **Secrets Management:** AWS Secrets Manager for storing and retrieving sensitive credentials (e.g., Snowflake connection details).

**5\. Deployment and Infrastructure as Code**

* AWS CloudFormation or Terraform will be used to define and provision all AWS infrastructure components (SNS topic, SQS queue, DynamoDB table, Lambda functions, S3 bucket, IAM roles, etc.).  
* A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild) will be set up to automate the deployment of Lambda function code and infrastructure updates.

**6\. Monitoring and Logging**

* AWS CloudWatch Logs will be used for centralized logging of all Lambda functions and other AWS services.  
* CloudWatch Metrics will be used to monitor key performance indicators (e.g., Lambda invocation count, error rate, duration, SQS queue length, DynamoDB read/write capacity, Snowpipe load status).  
* CloudWatch Alarms will be configured to trigger notifications for critical events (e.g., high error rates, long queue lengths, throttling).  
* AWS X-Ray will be considered for tracing requests across different components to aid in debugging and performance analysis.

**7\. Data Governance and Retention**

* Clear data retention policies will be documented for both DynamoDB and Snowflake.  
* Automated mechanisms (e.g., DynamoDB TTL, Snowflake data retention policies, S3 lifecycle policies) will be implemented to enforce these policies.  
* Access controls in Snowflake will be strictly enforced based on roles and responsibilities.

**8\. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Initial Release)**

* More complex data transformations within the processing Lambda.  
* Integration with other data sources in Snowflake.  
* Implementation of data quality checks.
